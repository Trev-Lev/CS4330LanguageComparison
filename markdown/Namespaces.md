##### Namespaces

###### Java

In Java, namespaces are implemented through packages and classes (and their subclasses). To use them, they are imported at the top of a Java source code file.

An example of an import:
```Java
/* Import all of java.util - this
includes collections, scanner, etc.
*/
import java.util.*;
```

###### Kotlin

In Kotlin, namespaces are implemented in a similar manner as they are in Java. Just like with Java, the package is described at the top of the document:

```Java
package foo.bar
```

and the imports are usually right below:
```Java
import foo.*
```

Note that Kotlin does not use semicolons!
