##### Language purpose and Genesis

###### Why was the language created?

**Java** began development in 1991 at Sun Microsystems. The original goal was to program home appliances, but a programming language that could control many different computer processors was needed. Soon, it was seen that this language could be very useful on the web.

As the story goes, the language was originally called **Oak**, after a tree outside of developer James Gosling's window. However, after discovering another language had this name already, Gosling's team went out for coffee and ended up calling the language **Java**.

**Kotlin** was unveiled in 2011 and its cited purpose was to create a programming language that had features that JetBrains was looking for with the ability to compile as quickly as **Java**. **Kotlin** runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

As for the name, **Kotlin** was named after an Island near St. Petersburg, as the developers thought that the programming language **Java** was named after the island of Java.

###### What problems was the language trying to address?

**Java** was created while trying to address the problem of having one programming language that can run on various different computer processors. As the internet became more ubiquitous, **Java** came to have a home there too.

**Kotlin** was created when JetBrains decided that they needed a language like Scala, but with a compile time comparable to Java.

###### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

**Java** was not initially intended to be a replacement or a reaction to a previous language, but one may interpret its "Write once, run anywhere" (WORA) component to mean that it can replace other languages. Additionally, the syntax of **Java** was created so that it would not vary too much from the existing languages C/C++, so programmers could easily transition.

**Kotlin** is intended to run on the JVM and to be an industrial strength object-oriented language, and  to be "better" than **Java**. **Kotlin** is still fully interoperable with Java code (for example, the Android compiler allows the user to choose between Java 6 or Java 8 compatible bytecode), which allows for a migration from **Java** to **Kotlin** for companies to make.
