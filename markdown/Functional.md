##### Functional programming

###### Is Java a functional programming language?
It sort of depends on your definition of functional. The addition of lambda expressions in Java 8 is a functional programming element, and there are other ways to make Java resemble a functional programming language, but the building blocks are absent. It is necessary to make good use of the 'final' keyword, but if you want to program in a functional paradigm you should probably **not** use Java.

###### Is Kotlin a functional programming language?
For the most part, yes! Kotlin offers plenty of more functional elements than just the 'final' keyword and recently-added lambda expressions. There exists first-class functions, lambda expressions (to a better degree than those found in Java), tail recursion, type inference, and collection operations. If being a sequel to Java means improving upon its abilities as a functional programming language, then Kotlin has succeeded.
