##### Unique features

###### Java
Java is unique in its cross-platform ability. At the time of its creation, the ability to write Java code and run it on nearly any system was very unique, and it still is today (though there are now other languages that boast cross-platform abilities). In addition to its cross-platform ability, as a high level language Java is easy to understand, having a similar syntax to C/C++ code, but without the memory management due to its garbage collection ability.

###### Kotlin
Kotlin is unique in that it is built to be a type of sequel to Java. While still a relatively new language (unveiled in 2011), Kotlin directly improves upon many things that Java does not, as well as having a few unique qualities of its own.

For example,
- Kotlin as nullable variables, also known as optionals
- Classes are final by default
- Can be compiled to JavaScript source code
- Extension functions
- Data Classes
- Coroutines

And there are plenty more unlisted benefits of Kotlin.
