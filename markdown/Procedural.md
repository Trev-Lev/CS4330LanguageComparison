##### Procedural programming

###### Java
Despite being mainly referred to as a purely object-oriented language (which it *almost* is), both procedural and object-oriented programming are supported in Java.

Java was designed to resemble C/C++ code and can run without the need to create different types of objects to create a program, and supports top-level functions. Java's strength comes from object-oriented programming, however.

###### Kotlin
Kotlin, operating on the same JVM as Java, is the same from this standpoint. It can operate in an object-oriented manner and has the same procedural features that are offered in Java - for example, the top-level functions that work outside of a class.
